I believe this is how the professor wanted it to be done, but if not please feel free to let me know.
Ran on eclipse, and there is a screenshot (Cases.png) of the cases being fulfilled.

Thoughts:
1. Possibly shorten the buffer size to reduce wait time of the cases
2. A different form of output for the in between - ex: "Buffer is partially full"
